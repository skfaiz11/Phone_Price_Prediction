# Mobile-price-prediction

## Abstract:
There is a new mobile company and the CEO wants to give a tough fight to big companies like Apple, Samsung etc. He has no idea of how to estimate the price of mobiles his company creates. A simple assumption of the prices will not be profitable in this competitive world. To solve this problem he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies. Thus, the CEO has hired you to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory etc) and its selling price

### Problem Statement:
Predict a price range, indicating how high the price is, using different Machine Learning algorithms.

### Scope:
● Prepare and analyse data, treat outliers and missing values

● Check the distribution of key numerical variables, eda 

● Building different Machine Learning models, hyperparameter tuning

### Learning Outcome:
The students will get a better understanding of how the variables are linked to each other and how the EDA approach will help them gain more insights and knowledge about the data that we have
